## General-Piracy
- [Awesome Piracy](https://github.com/Igglybuff/awesome-piracy) A huge curated list of piracy resources. Some of the links are outdated, but the source is incredibly invaluable none-the-less. [Awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome#readme) lists in general are very useful.
- [Archive.org](https://archive.org/) Home of the wayback-machine. Basically the library of the internet as far as media is concerned. So much is on here it's rediculous. If you're in a collection, be sure to view all files on the right panel if you're looking for a specific file. Some may require you to sign in.
- [The Proxy Bay](https://proxybay.github.io/) List of mirror sites pulling from The Pirate Bay's database. Visiting the pirate bay directly is sketchy these days, but it's database will always be invaluable. Do note however that in more recent times, their collection has become more and more unmoderated over time, so tred with caution.
- [Rarbg](https://rarbg.to/) Movie torrenting site. Use [Rarbg Proxy](https://rarbg-proxy.github.io/) if it's blocked in your country.
- [Piracy.moe](https://piracy.moe/) Previously known as the anime index, a spreadsheet for anime, manga, and other weeb piracy warez
- [Nyaa.si](https://nyaa.si/) Anime torrenting database. Probably the best out there. My first line of fire for anime piracy. [sukebei.nyaa.si](sukebei.nyaa.si) is their NSFW counterpart.
- [Soulseek](https://www.slsknet.org/) Peer-to-Peer network for (mostly) music piracy. A lot like how Limewire worked. If you're on Linux use [Nicotine+](https://nicotine-plus.org/) to access soulseek.
- [YayPonies](https://yayponies.no/) basically all official digital media for the My Little Pony franchise. Show, Movie, Comic Books, Bonus features, etc. They also link to sister sites hosting Star Vs The Forces of Evil and Wander Over Yonder content (and deprecated Ducktales and Steven Universe content).

### Media-Servers
- [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) Basically, host your own damn netflix, with blackjack and hookers! Free open source software, lets you stream media from your own server. You can even just give family and friends the website, username, and password, and they can stream your library too. Movies, Tv, Music, as well as a group watch feature which automatically syncs the video between viewers in case you're watching online together and dont want to have to manually sync every time someone wants to pause. Supports [a ton of devices](https://jellyfin.org/clients/).
- [Plex](https://www.plex.tv) Similar to jellyfin, but with more bells, whistles, and plug-in support. Unfortunately, not open source, and contains paywalled features.
    - [dizquetv](https://github.com/vexorian/dizquetv) A plug-in for plex which lets you create a live "TV channel" autopopulated from content on your plex server. You could even add TV Bumpers.
    - [Retroarcher](https://github.com/RetroArcher) A plug-in for plex which also lets you stream videogames. Under heavy development.


## Videogames

### Videogame-Piracy
- [Magnet Games](https://magnet-games.com/index.php) Cute website that has torrents for complete game sets to most retro consoles. Click a console in the header, go to anything/collections, and you'll want to torrent no-intro if it's available for that console. Curate the list in your torrent manager from there.
- [Old Games Finder](http://www.oldgamesfinder.com/) Search engine to find copies of old PC games. Some sites it may lead you to are paid, but not all.
- [Vimm's Lair](https://vimm.net/?p=vault) Okay piracy site for downloading individual retro games, however limits the numbers of downloads you can have running at once, and can be quite slow.
- [EmuParadise](https://www.emuparadise.me/Complete_ROM_Sets_(Full_Sets_in_One_File)_ROMs/List-All-Titles/37) Famous rom site that was sued by nintendo a few years back. Hasn't been the same since, but is still useful. Some games have been delisted by the site's search engine, so use 3rd party search engines to search games on their database.
    -[EmuParadise Workaround Script](https://gist.github.com/infval/c69b479ff0bd590f2dd7e1975fe2fcad) Is a [userscript](#userscripts) to allow downloading of games from EmuParadise again. Since nintendo sued them years ago. Most if not all the roms are still on their servers, they just removed the download links. On a game page use "download with workaround script".
- [Archive.org Gamecube Collection by Ghostware](https://archive.org/details/GamecubeCollectionByGhostware) Full North American ISO set of gamecube games. Be sure to log in and either show all files and pick which you want, or get the torrent and manage from there in your torrent manager.
- [Archive.org Wii Collection by Ghostware](https://archive.org/details/WiiRomSetByGhostware), [Part 2](https://archive.org/details/WiiRomSetByGhostwarePart2), [Part 3](https://archive.org/details/WiiRomSetByGhostwarePart3) 3 part collection of commercial Wii games.
- [Archive.org WiiWare Collection by Ghostware](https://archive.org/details/WiiWareCollectionByGhostware) Full .wad set for WiiWare downloadable games from the Wii Shop Channel, virtual console included.
- [NXBrew](https://nxbrew.com/) Site hosting Nintendo Switch NSPs (games).
- [r/CrackWatch](https://old.reddit.com/r/CrackWatch/) Gaming piracy subreddit. Will tell you who cracked a game and removed it's DRM if a game has been cracked, which should give you enough information on where to find said cracked game. Also carries with it other useful info. Be sure to read the beginners guide on the sidebar.
- [Pirated Games Mega Thread](https://rentry.co/pgames-mega-thread) Lists resources curated by those at r/CrackWatch, as well as some anti-recommendations so you know what to watch out for. Anything on my list superseeds anything here (at least for me) obviously.  
- [Fitgirl Repacks](https://fitgirl-repacks.site/) Repacks for more modern games. (Repacks are compressed versions of games, meaning they're inherently not going to be fully accurate, but I've rarely had problems). As for other repackers, fitgirl endources RG Mechanics, RG Revenants, RG Catalyst, Xatab, El Amigos, Kapital Sin, and KaosKrew (rips). However I've never had to use them.
- [Free GOG Games](https://freegogpcgames.com/) Free release for every game on GOG, since they're all DRM free.

### Videogame-Emulation
- [Emulation Wiki](https://emulation.gametechwiki.com/) A wiki on videogame emulation. Extremely useful if you want to compare and contrast features of emulators for a given console. Especially good for figuring out what the best given emulator for a console is.
- [Retroarch](https://www.retroarch.com/)  The frontend for libretro. Nice if you want to have all your retro games in one place, navigatable with a controller, and especially useful if you're looking to use it's unique features (netplay, shaders, etc). Download emulators as cores from within the program, scan for your games, and then run the game with their respective core. Easier than it sounds. I prefer it to standalone counterparts for most emulators, but not all. Also sick for emulating on console, I have retroarch installed on my Switch, for example. Switch Online SNES and NES library be damned. 
     - I would like to note however, that if you do not need to use retroarch, I would avoid it. There's been a lot of claims of abusive behavior from one of the lead developers, TwinAphex. Including potentially contributing to Near's suicide, and driving devs to quit projects and leave the emu scene (ex duckstation's lead developer). I'm having trouble finding much definitive information on it all, but I'd be remiss not to mention it. Hopefully the scene creates a competetive alternative some day. If you're on mac, I'd recommend [OpenEmu](https://openemu.org/) above retroarch in most cases anyhow.
- Emulator Compatability Lists. Basically, for any given emulator, they'll list all games for the console they're emulating, and how well they're emulated. In the case of the [Dolphin Wiki](https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) they'll even list optimal emulator settings, enhancements, and more for individual games.

### Videogame-Other
- [Hacking & Homebrew](https://rentry.co/Guides) From the homebrew threads on 4chan's /vg/ board. Follow any guide here for it's respective console and you wont have any trouble if you have basic reading comprehension. Also provides links to piracy websites in the post-instillation sections.
    - [webcfw](https://webcfw.sdsetup.com/) Nintendo Switch Payload Loader that works in chromium browsers. For booting into switch hacks. 
- [SteamGridDB](https://www.steamgriddb.com/) Database of cover assets for Steam, since a lot of games are missing covers and the like. Includes non-steam games as well, in case you put those in your steam library.


## Privacy
- [Privacy Guides](https://privacyguides.org/) Basically the authority in protecting your privacy and making your digital life more secure, in my opinion.
- [Techlore](https://www.youtube.com/c/Techlore) A YouTube channel that posts super helpful recommendations and guides on all things privacy. Also hosts a weekly show called [Surveillance Report](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3KeV6Ui_4CZemCIsHUIuEtugAmUxAYHS) which recaps news and important events in the quickly everchanging world of privacy. They also have a [website](https://techlore.tech).
- [FOSS Front-Ends](https://gitlab.com/FSMdotCOM/foss-front-ends-and-alternatives) Free Open Source Software alternatives to and tools to various popular services, such as many social media platforms.
- [CalyxOS](https://calyxos.org/) A private operating system for google pixel (and some other select) devices. Comes with MicroG, which lets you use google services without having to give google any data. Also includes strong sandboxing features to keep apps from connecting to the internet or uploading data from other apps.
- [F-Droid/NeoStore](https://github.com/NeoApplications/Neo-Store) A client for F-Droid. F-Droid is a Play Store alternative which only hosts manually approved apps which meet very strict privacy and security criteria. 
- [ArouraStore](auroraoss.com) A FOSS alternative to the Play Store. Lets you download apps from the playstore without signing in to Google, and without giving Google any real data about you. Also includes a section under every app showing how many trackers it has if they've been reported to the database. It is available on F-Droid.
- [Insular](https://gitlab.com/secure-system/Insular) A FOSS app that sandboxes apps you select into a seperate profile which can be turned on and off. Good for keeping apps which you dont trust to send as little data about you as possible, as well as make sure they're all turned off entirely when insular's profile is turned off. It is available on F-Droid.
- [NewPipe](https://newpipe.net/) A FOSS app that lets you watch YouTube on your phone without signing in to Google. It also allows you to download videos, listen to them in the background, skip ads, and skip sponsored segments. Basically everything YouTube Preimum offers and more. Also supports bandcamp and soundcloud for music streaming. It is available on F-Droid.
- [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) Privacy focused Google alternative. Help stop the Google monopoly today! Don't "Google it", ask your duck!
- [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com) Privacy focused e-mail service. Their frontpage is a little bit misleading about what it can do, and quite frankly e-mail just is plain not a private protocol, but at least they're not selling your data. Will not protect you from feds (no e-mail service will).
- [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) Best password manager that I know of. Free, secure, private, and functional.


### VPNs
- All entries in this section are taken from [This Techlore Video](https://youtu.be/cpjYN8Q7Mz8)

- [IVPN](https://www.ivpn.net/) Fast, private, no bullshit VPN that openly tells you what a VPN is and isn't good for and if you actually need one. Transparency reports, warrant canaries, 2FA, the works. Supports Wireguard. Email-less signup option. They have no affiliate plan. Many people who know what they're talking about consider it the best. Go with this or ProtonVPN, whichever gives you better speeds to be honest. Priced at $60/yr for standard and $100/yr for pro.
- [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/) Fast, private, no bullshit VPN. Transparency reports, warrant canaries, the works. No 2FA, unfortunately.

Priced at $48/yr for basic and $96/yr for preimum at the time of writing.
- [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net) Great, but no transparency report, no warrant canaries, no 2FA. Otherwise fast and no bullshit VPN. Priced at €5/mo ($5.46/mo), which translates to €60/yr ($65.54/yr).


## Addons

### Browser-Extensions

- [Sponsorblock](https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock) Skip youtube sponsors. Works better than you'd think it would. Also offers options to skip recaps, non-music sections of music videos, self-promo, and more.
- [DarkReader](https://darkreader.org/) A quick way to make websites dark which dont have a dark theme. Though i'd still recommend native dark themes for websites if they support the feature, as sometimes dark reader can hide elements which are supposed to be visible. Able to be toggled on a per-website basis, and toggleable with a hotkey.
- [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) An extension that lets you load userscripts. Think of them like modifications to websites, without being their own full extension. If an extension has a userscript version, jump for it. Your ram will thank you. You can find userscripts I use below.
- [Save Tabbed Images](https://github.com/kevinsqi/save_tabbed_images) Good for if you want to just open a new window, open a ton of images in new tabs, and download them all. Constantly removed from the chrome webstore for some reason, and loves to uninstall it's self from chrome. I dont think google likes this one, but there's ways to get it to run none-the-less.

### Userscripts
- [Tampermonkey scripts list](https://www.tampermonkey.net/scripts.php) Page listing resources for finding new userscripts.
- [Userstyles.org](https://userstyles.org/) Website for sharing cosmetic website modifications. Install them as userscripts, dont use stylish. Included because it isn't in Tampermonkey's script list for some reason.

- [Anti Adblock Killer](https://reek.github.io/anti-adblock-killer/) You know those pop-ups you get sometimes when using an adblocker? This helps to get rid of those. Install and forget.
- [AAK Cont for uBlock Origin](https://xuhaiyang1234.gitlab.io/AAK-Cont/dist/aak-cont-script-ubo.user.js) Anti-Adblock Killer Continued for uBlock Origin. Should be self-explanitory.
- [Chrome Dark Scrollbar and Audio Player](https://userstyles.org/styles/108298) I was having trouble getting chrome themes to have a dark scrollbar, so here's a userscript for getting a dark scrollbar on chrome.
- [BetterTTV](https://betterttv.com/) More emotes, features, etc for twitch. Select "other" browser even if your browser is supported for the userscript.
- [Twitter Download Gif&Video](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/390723-twitter-download-gif-video) Adds a little button on twitter gif and videos to more easily download them.

- [BDFDB](https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Library/) Required Library for a lot of plugins made by DevilBro, who's heavily involved and very prolific in the scene. A lot of plugins are dependant on it.

## Other
- [diyhrt.github.io](https://diyhrt.github.io/) Do It Yourself Horomone Replacement Therapy. Especially useful if the system is failing you (underdosing, gatekeeping), but even barring that it's an alternative to be considered to give you more control over your transition and possibly even save you some dosh.

- [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/) A port of Adobe Photoshop to browser. Too good to be true and yet somehow it is. Works better than it has any right to. Use [Photopea Adblock](https://userstyles.org/styles/178522/adblock-photopea) as well. uBlock already blocks ads on photopea, but the space is still reserved for the ad. Using this will fill the whole screen and remove the adspace. This is a [userscript](#userscripts).
